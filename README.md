# logRace

This codecademy javascript project, takes in user input and evaluates using conditional statements in order to prompt the user the correct information for their marathon race times

* if the user is above the age of 18 and registered early, the user is prompted that their race will begin at 9:30am
* if the user is above the age of 18 and did not register early, the user is prompted that their race will begin at 11:00am
* if the user is below the age of 18, in this condition it does not matter if they registered early or not, the user will be prompted that their race will begin at 12:30pm
* if the user is exactly 18, in this condition it does not matter if they registered early or not, the user will be prompted to see registration desk for further assistance
* users above the age of 18 will have 1000 added to their race number in ordert to keep track of age difference
* I used string comparison in order to assign true and false booleans value to the either yes and no answer given by the user
